# Hadamard product for counters

Functions to compute the Hadamard product, its residual, and its dual residual on counters. The code is written on top of the library [ETVO](http://perso-laris.univ-angers.fr/~cottenceau/etvo.html) ((Event|Time)-Variant Operators).

See <http://perso-laris.univ-angers.fr/~cottenceau/etvo.html> for the start-up instructions.
The added functions are `hadamard_prod`, `hadamard_res`, and `hadamard_dualres`, which compute the Hadamard product, its residual, and its dual residual, respectively.
They accept two inputs, which must be elements of class `gd` (monomials), `poly` (polynomials), or `series` (ultimately periodic series).

## Code examples

Consider monomials ![equation](https://latex.codecogs.com/png.image?%5Cbg_white%20r_1&space;=&space;5\delta^2) and ![equation](https://latex.codecogs.com/png.image?%5Cbg_white%20r_2&space;=&space;3\delta^2).
The following code produces ![equation](https://latex.codecogs.com/png.image?%5Cbg_white%20r_1\odot&space;r_2&space;=&space;8\delta^2), ![equation](https://latex.codecogs.com/png.image?%5Cbg_white%20r_1\odot^\sharp&space;r_2&space;=&space;2\delta^{&plus;\infty}), and ![equation](https://latex.codecogs.com/png.image?%5Cbg_white%20r_1\odot^\flat&space;r_2&space;=&space;2\delta^2).

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include "etvo.h"
using namespace etvo;

void main()
{
    // initialize monomials
    gd r_1, r_2, res_odot, res_odot_sharp, res_odot_flat;

    // define $r_1$ and $r_2$
    r_1 = gd(5, 2); 
    r_2 = gd(3, 2);

    // print $r_1$ and $r_2$
    cout << "r_1 = " << r_1 << endl;
    cout << "r_2 = " << r_2 << endl;

    // compute $r_1\odot r_2$, $r_1\odot^\sharp r_2$, and $r_1\odot^\flat r_2$
    res_odot = hadamard_prod(r_1, r_2);
    res_odot_sharp = hadamard_res(r_1, r_2);
    res_odot_flat = hadamard_dualres(r_1, r_2);

    // print the results
    cout << "res_odot = " << res_odot << endl;
    cout << "res_odot_sharp = " << res_odot_sharp << endl;
    cout << "res_odot_flat = " << res_odot_flat << endl;
}
```

An example showing how to use the functions to solve an optimal-control problem for timed event graphs with resource sharing can be found in `mainHadamard.cpp`, see function `train_station_example_WODES()`.
The example is taken from [[1, Section 4]](#1).
Other examples are documented in the [[2, Section 4]](#2).

## Proof of the correctness of the algorithms

The correctness of the algorithms for computing the Hadamard product, its residual, and its dual residual between monomials, polynomials, and ultimately periodic formal power series is proven in [[2, Section 3]](#2).

## Performance evaluation

Function `performance_evaluation()` in `mainHadamard.cpp` measures the computational time to solve an optimal-control problem for timed event graphs with resoure sharing and output-reference update.
The results of the tests are reported in [[1, Section 5]](#1).
